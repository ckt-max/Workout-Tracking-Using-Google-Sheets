# Workout-Tracking-Using-Google-Sheets
Python program to take a sentence as an input consisting of all the workout you did and convert it into relevant data and save it into a Google Sheet

Steps in the program:
1. The program after running asks for the workout you did today, Which is going to be saved in a string variable called query because it is just a sentence in normal language
2. This query is converted to relevant name of workouts such as swimming and cycling, along with the calories consumed in each workout with the help of NUTRITIONIX API
3. This data is then saved into a Google sheet using sheety API!

Here's the sheet generated after putting some workouts[sheet](https://github.com/ckt-max/Workout-Tracking-Using-Google-Sheets/assets/70205544/eb3f36e6-0c00-4a0b-9682-f0872f11e923)
